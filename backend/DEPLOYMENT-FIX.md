# Railway Deployment Fix - Complete âœ…

## What Was Fixed

1. **Package-lock.json Sync Issue**
   - Railway was failing because `npm ci` requires exact package-lock.json match
   - Regenerated package-lock.json to match package.json
   - Removed all Prisma/SQLite references

2. **Changes Pushed to GitHub**
   - All fixes committed and pushed
   - Railway will auto-redeploy from GitHub

## Next Steps

1. **Check Railway Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://railway.com/project/dc81835b-76b7-4cd7-b85a-c8e1b470dd34
   - The deployment should now succeed (green checkmark)

2. **Get Your API URL**
   - Once deployed, Railway will provide: `https://proconnect-health-production.up.railway.app`
   - Copy this URL

3. **Update Vercel Frontend**
   ```bash
   vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production
   echo "https://proconnect-health-production.up.railway.app" | vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production
   vercel --prod
   ```
