### The 10-Second Pitch:
"I'm solving the nursing shortage. Takes 30 seconds to sign up. 
You'll know every hospital that wants you. What's your specialty?"

### Sign-Up Script:
1. "What's your license number?" → Type it
2. "What's your specialty?" → ICU/ER/Med-Surg
3. "Where do you want to work?" → Location
4. "Done! You'll get matched today."

### Target Nurses:
- ICU specialists (priority)
- Night shift nurses (hardest to fill)
- Travel nurses ending contracts
- Nurses from Kaiser/UCSF (poachable)

## Monday Afternoon: Contact Stanford

### Email #1 (2pm):
```
To: mary.haddad@stanfordhealthcare.org
Subject: I have 10 ICU nurses ready to interview

Mary,

I noticed Stanford has 12 open ICU positions that have been 
unfilled for 60+ days.

I have 10 verified ICU nurses ready to interview. They're local 
and can start immediately.

First hire is free. No fees unless they stay 90 days.

Can I send you their profiles today?

Best,
[Your name]
[Your phone]

P.S. This takes 5 minutes of your time, not 5 months.
```

### If No Response - Email #2 (Tuesday 9am):
```
Subject: Re: I have 10 ICU nurses ready to interview

Mary,

Quick update - I now have 15 ICU nurses interested in Stanford.

Three have CCRN certification and 5+ years trauma experience.

Should I send them to someone else on your team?

[Your name]
```

### Direct Call Script (Tuesday 2pm):
"Hi, I'm calling for Mary Haddad. I sent her profiles of 
15 ICU nurses yesterday. They're ready to interview this week. 
Can you put me through?"

If gatekeeper: "It's about filling the ICU positions immediately."

   - Smaller, more agile

2. **Good Samaritan San Jose** (20 min away)
   - Contact: HR Department
   - Known for quick decisions

3. **Valley Medical Center** (25 min away)
   - Public hospital, desperate for staff
   - Lower bar for vendors

### Physical:

- [ ] Backup battery pack
- [ ] Notepad for manual backup

### Outfit:
- Business casual (not suit)
- Comfortable shoes (lots of standing)
- Name tag: "ProConnect Health"

## The Mindset

**Remember:**
- You're not selling software
- You're solving their crisis
- You have what they desperately need
- First hire changes everything

**Jobs would say:**
"We're not asking for permission. We're delivering salvation."

## If Everything Goes Wrong

**Plan B:**
1. Sign up nurses anyway (build inventory)
2. Go directly to Stanford HR office
3. Find any hiring manager
4. Show them real nurses on platform
5. Get ONE interview scheduled

**The Only Metric That Matters:**
One nurse hired at Stanford by Friday.

Everything else is noise.

"Real artists ship."
